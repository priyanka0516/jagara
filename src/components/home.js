                        <p>Odisha was known as Utkala during ancient and medieval times. Utkala the name itself means – the land of excellence in art and craft. The art forms are visual manifestations of the rich cultural heritage of Odisha and reflect a tradition that still lives in the creative imagination and skill of her craftsmen.<br />
                        <br/>Diverse, vibrant, and utilitarian the art and craft of Odisha range from —stonework, silver filigree, woodcraft, appliqué work, brass and bell metal work, dhokra castings, horn work, pattachitra, paper mache, terracotta, tie & dye textile in cotton,tassar and silk to name a few.

                        <li>A non-Fungible Token or NFT marketplace is a marketplace that functions as a public Blockchain platform. However, this platform is gaining traction and driving developers and businesses to construct a marketplace, despite being in its nascent stage.</li>
                        <li>Online marketplaces for digital assets are the recent talk of the fintech town. But, of course, you have to build your own marketplace if you are planning to set foot in the digital market. The words cryptocurrency trading and blockchain technology are no longer unknown, and many people trade goods on several marketplaces.</li>
                        <li>Proponents of NFTs claim that NFTs provide a public certificate of authenticity or proof of ownership. The ownership of an NFT as defined by the blockchain has no inherent legal meaning and does not necessarily grant copyright, intellectual property rights, or other legal rights over its associated digital file.</li>
                        <span>Conceptualizing NFT marketplace</span>
                        <li>It is a platform that makes it simple to store and sell NFTs. These tokens are generally available for purchase or auction at a set price. To use an NFT marketplace, you will need a crypto wallet to store and trade your best NFT tokens.</li>
                        <li>Users have to create an account, upload digital artwork, and sell their work on the marketplace. In general, specialized marketplaces are more popular than conventional ones because they include everything a client would require—specialized marketplaces’ expertise in promoting online artworks and concentrating on specific target audiences.</li>

                <p><strong>1. Unlocking the value of physical assets as digital tokens
                </strong><br/> Today, it takes one click to buy an airline ticket or a new sweater, but if you want to buy stocks or get a mortgage, transactions are more time intensive. Whether it’s waiting for documents or settlement, many types of transactions aren’t instant. Assets like gold, real estate, fine art, or carbon credits are more difficult to transfer, often obligating buyers and sellers to contend with mountains of paperwork and lengthy procedures. By representing physical assets as digital tokens on a distributed digital ledger or blockchain, it’s possible to unlock the value of real-world assets and exchange them in real time. 
                </p>
                <p><strong>2. Accelerating the exchange of value using blockchain.</strong><br/>
                Today’s cross-border payment processes are fraught with time delays, complexity, and inefficiencies. Payments are the backbone of global commerce, but payment in real-time has yet to be achieved. Whether it’s payments or other asset classes, the ability to move real-world assets onto a blockchain offers the advantages of a secure digital platform, while retaining the characteristics of the asset. Securitization is the process through which contractual obligations such as mortgages, car loans, personal debt, or receivables are pooled, and their cash flows are sold as standard units to investors.<br/><br/>
                Digitization of assets is a process in which the rights to an asset are converted into a digital token on a blockchain. Ownership rights are transmitted and traded on a digital platform, and the real-world assets on the blockchain are represented by digital tokens.</p>

Therefore, the counterfeiters could add a tracking feature to their fake products. The idea of tracking physical objects through PUFs is not new, but there is no concept of how this immutable property can be transferred to the digital layer. The blockchain is regarded as an unchangeable data structure due to the decentralized architecture, which is why we will examine how these technologies can be used to secure the distribution pathways of products.</li>
                        <li>The drying process results in cracks and patterns that are unique, their origin is chaotic and not predictable. The crack patterns are produced on different granularities in terms of crack size, depending on the varnish used. The resulting pattern can be read as a fingerprint for physical products. This means that each product can be uniquely identified. Some paints lead to fine cracks that can only be seen under a microscope. Other lacquer results in a rough crack pattern, which is already clearly visible in pictures taken with conventional mobile phone cameras.</li>
                        <li>These are particularly suitable for use in the supply chain, as these mobile devices are accessible to the mass market. The crack pattern of the varnish is unique if the product packaging or the product itself is provided with it.</li>

                        <li>By establishing a decentralized ledger for payments (e.g., Bitcoin), blockchain technology could facilitate faster payments at lower fees than banks.</li>
                        <li>Many types of financial assets are already digital, such as when cash is represented as numbers on a screen. But tokens enable certain assets to move swiftly across digital platforms or networks. Opportunities for cross-border trade increase as geographic barriers are removed. Tokenization can unlock new markets for previously frozen, underutilized, or illiquid assets and offers possibilities for new types of fractional ownership.</li>
                        <li>The use of digital assets (sometimes called crypto-currencies) such as XRP (an independent digital asset) can help financial institutions convert funds into the desired currency instantly.</li>
                        <li>The financial ecosystem needs to be looking at implementing thoughtful regulations that can encourage innovative solutions for cross-border payments. At the same time, any implementation of blockchain technology should be done responsibly, with a careful amount of deliberation over the security, risk, and stability of cross-border payment solutions.</li>

                        <li>Blockchain is a data structure or a method to store digital records in a decentralized way – implying that no central authority has access to the operations of this system. As a result of this robust approach, a blockchain-based system is always unhackable, transparent, and of course, immutable as well.</li>
                        <li>Data in the blockchain is stored in a decentralized manner. This means data is not stored on one server as in classic software systems. Even cloud systems use centralized servers. Blockchain data is distributed over the network by connected devices, so-called nodes. Blocks are linked to each other resulting in a chained data structure. These blocks are secured by cryptography.</li>
